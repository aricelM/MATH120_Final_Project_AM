Math 120 Final

In order to run the Cross Product and Dot Product functions follow the following steps. 

1. Open a python compiler 
2. Make sure to import Numpy to be able to use numpy.dot(), numpy.vdot(), and numpy.cross()
3. You can adjust the values of each array to calculate those products to your liking. 

Thank you.
