# ## Topic: Linear Algebra

# Definitions:
# - Vectors are quantities of both a magnitude and a direction.
# - Scalars are quantities described only by a magnitude (or numerical value) alone.

# ## Dot product <a id='dotproduct'></a>

# - The dot product is used to multiply two vectors.
# - When you multiply the two vectors you will end up with a scalar value.

#Method 2 is using numpy. Numpy has two ways of getting the dot product 
#First one is np.dot() which takes two ARRAYS and returns the dot product 
np.dot(3, 4)


# In[61]:


np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])


# In[62]:


#Second one is np.vdot which takes two VECTORS and returns the dot product 
#This function handels the complex numbers differently then the np.dot() function. 
np.vdot(3, 4)


# ## Cross Product <a id='crossproduct'></a>

# Definitions:
# - The cross product is a second way to multiple two vectors but it is used for vectors in $R^3$. Meaning Vectors with 3 inputs only.

# In[94]:


#Method 1 using crosss product fucntion using 2 arrays 
#If the length of the arrays are larger than 3 you will get an index error b/c index will be out of range.
